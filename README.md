3 Features of this Project:


i) Category-Based Filtering:

    Users can easily find donation details in specific categories (Education, Health, Food, Clothing) using the search field on the homepage. 
    This feature improves user experience by allowing them to quickly access the information that matters most to them.

ii) Donation Tracking and Confirmation:

    When users click on a donation, they are taken to a dedicated page where they can view donation details and initiate a donation. 
    After making a donation, a toast notification is displayed, providing immediate feedback and confirmation of their action. This feature enhances user engagement and trust in the donation process.

iii) Statistics and Visualization:

    The "Statistics" section in the navigation bar provides users with a visual representation of their contributions through a pie chart. 
    This feature allows users to see the total donations they've made and the total donations available at a glance, promoting transparency and accountability in the donation process.


These features collectively enhance the usability and effectiveness of your donation website, making it user-friendly and informative for donors and potential contributors.
